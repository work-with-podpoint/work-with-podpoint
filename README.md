## Mission

At Pod Point we believe travel shouldn’t damage the Earth.

It’s this belief that gets us out of bed in the morning and what we’re all working towards. We want to look back one day and know we played a fundamental role in the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) - it would be pretty great, wouldn’t it? Just imagine... better air quality, less CO2 emissions, global warming a reduced threat.

That’s our vision and we are always looking for **new talents** (this is you) to help us on our mission.

So, to make our vision a reality, our mission is to make sure electric vehicle charging is:

1. Smart
2. Available everywhere
3. Easy (to use)!
